\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Project Goals}
The primary goal of this project is to design and implement a comprehensive university website that offers a personalized
 and functional experience for different types of users. The website will provide students, teachers, library staff and other security personnel with an interface to manage their profiles, interact with others, and access university resources based on their 
 roles. The website is expected to enhance user engagement, facilitate communication, and streamline administrative processes 
 within the university. 

\subsection{Target Users and Use Cases} The target users of the website include students, teachers, library staff, security personnel, 
administrative staff and external visitors. Each user type has specific features tailored to their role:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Students}: Students will have access to their dashboard, which display timetables, profiles, and 
  enrolled courses. They can register for courses, check their grades, interact with teachers and fellow students, view library 
  collections, and check their own borrowing history, as well as manage their electric bike licenses.
  \item \textbf{Teachers}: Teachers will have a dashboard that shows the courses they teach, timetable, profiles, and office 
  location. They can create and manage courses, interact with students, view library collections.
  \item \textbf{Library staff}: Library staff will have access to features that allow them to manage book inventories, track book 
  loans, and assist users with book reservations. They can also update library resources and monitor the availability of digital 
  content for users.
  \item \textbf{Security personnel}: Security personnel will manage electric bike licenses and oversee vehicle registrations on 
  campus.
  \item \textbf{Administrative staff}: Administrative users will have full control over the system, including managing user 
  registrations, overseeing course creation, and handling overall database management to ensure smooth system operation.
  \item \textbf{External visitors}: Unregistered users will have limited access to parts of the website, such as viewing general 
  information about the university, available library resources without the ability  interact with internal functions.  
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technological Stack Overview}
The university website will be built using a modern and robust technological stack to ensure reliability, security, and scalability. 
The core technologies to be used include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Frontend}: The user interface will be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and
     responsive design. Libraries like Bootstrap or Material UI may be incorporated for consistent styling across the website.
    \item \textbf{Backend}: The server-side logic will be implemented using Flask (Python), providing a flexible framework for 
    managing user authentication, database interactions, and session management.
    \item \textbf{Database}: MySQL will be used as the primary database management system to store user profiles, 
    course data, library resources, electric bike licenses, and forum information. The database will include the design of 
    tables with appropriate relationships, such as primary and foreign keys, to ensure data integrity and support efficient 
    querying and management.
    \item \textbf{Security}: The website will ensure secure handling of sensitive data, such as passwords, using encryption 
    mechanisms. Proper user authentication and authorization will be implemented to protect user privacy and data access.
\end{itemize}
This technology stack has been chosen for its simplicity, flexibility, and suitability for the scale of the university website project, 
ensuring a smooth user experience and maintainability.

    \texttt{library\_staff\_profile}, and \texttt{security\_personnel\_profile} links the 
    profiles to the core \texttt{user} table.
    \item The \texttt{course\_id} field in \texttt{course\_registration} and \texttt{student\_grades} links 
    students to the courses they have enrolled in and the grades they have received.
    \item The \texttt{license\_id} in the \texttt{e\_bike\_license} table allows students 
    to register electric bikes, which are approved by security personnel.
    \item The \texttt{post\_id} and \texttt{reply\_id} in the \texttt{forum\_post} and \texttt{forum\_reply} 
    tables link forum posts and their replies to the users who created them.
    \item The \texttt{user\_id} field in the \texttt{ui\_preferences} table links users to their personalized 
    interface settings, such as theme, font size, and color scheme.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Population Strategy}
The initial data for the \texttt{user}, \texttt{course}, and \texttt{library\_resources} 
tables will be seeded by administrators during development and testing phases. As users 
interact with the system, data will be dynamically added to the \texttt{course\_registration}, 
\texttt{student\_grades}, \texttt{library\_loan}, \texttt{e\_bike\_license}, \texttt{forum\_post}, 
\texttt{forum\_reply}, and \texttt{ui\_preferences} tables. The system will ensure that all data 
remains up-to-date and consistent across these entities, allowing users to track their course 
registrations, grades, library loans, and personalized interface preferences.

    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Code Components and Dependencies}
The application is built using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. The key components and their dependencies are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Flask Framework}: Provides the web framework for handling HTTP requests, routing, and rendering templates.
    \item \textbf{Flask-SQLAlchemy}: ORM for handling database interactions, providing seamless integration with MySQL for data persistence.
    \item \textbf{Flask-Login}: Manages user authentication and session management.
    \item \textbf{pymysql}: Used as the MySQL database driver for connecting to the remote database.
    \item \textbf{Werkzeug}: Provides password hashing and security utilities.
    \item \textbf{WTForms}: Provides form handling, validation, and CSRF protection.
    \item \textbf{Flask-Limiter}: Implements rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure security.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Database Interaction}
The application utilizes a remote MySQL database managed through SQLAlchemy, which acts as the Object Relational Mapper (ORM). The ORM abstracts the database operations into high-level Python objects, allowing the software framework to interact with the database seamlessly. CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are performed using model classes, which represent tables in the database.\\ \\ 
The database is remotely connected, with connection settings specified in the configuration file. The database connection is established during application initialization, ensuring a stable and secure interaction with the database throughout the application lifecycle. Below is the database host information:

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        \textbf{User} & \textbf{Database Host} & \textbf{Database Name} \\
        \hline
        root & \texttt{39.105.0.202:3306} & \texttt{WebApp} \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Database Host Information}
\end{table}

\subsection{Version Control and Repository Details}
The project uses Git for version control. The repository is hosted on GitLab, providing collaborative features such as pull requests, issue tracking, and version management. The main branch is used for stable releases, while development is done in separate feature branches. Commits are documented with clear messages, ensuring that changes are traceable, and the development workflow follows a feature-based branching model for effective collaboration.\\ \\
